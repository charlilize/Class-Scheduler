This is a Python project that builds class schedules based on user input and constraints.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `output.txt` : Outputs all the available classes for requested courses, schedules following users' ideal days of the week, and other possible schedules not following the ideal days of the week if requested.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages needed to run the project.
