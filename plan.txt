1. figure out how to create a schedule
A schedule is valid if:
* contains one section of every course in userCourses  ✅
* no section's time conflicts with the other (must be at least 15 minutes in between each section)   ✅

2. figure out how to filter according to days unwanted 
* follows a valid schedule AND ✅
* creates a schedule, if possible, that doesn't take place on filteredUnwantedDays

other tasks:
- could possibly get rid of the week structure, don't need it 
- make it print the schedules on wanted days then do an option to display schedules that are not on wanted days
