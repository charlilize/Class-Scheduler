1. figure out how to create a schedule
A schedule is valid if:
* contains one section of every course in userCourses  ✅

* no section's time conflicts with the other (must be at least 15 minutes in between each section) 
  - int toMilitaryTime function => convert to a single time to military time
  - boolean checkOverlap function => make sure that the end of the first class + 15 is less than the start of the second class 

2. figure out how to filter according to days unwanted 
* follows a valid schedule AND
* creates a schedule, if possible, that doesn't take place on filteredUnwantedDays
